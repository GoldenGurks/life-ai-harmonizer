# NutriPlan - Meal Planning Application

A comprehensive React-based meal planning application that helps users organize meals, track nutrition, manage shopping lists, and receive personalized recipe recommendations.

## Features

### üçΩÔ∏è Personalized Meal Planning
- Weekly meal planning with drag-and-drop interface
- AI-assisted meal recommendations based on preferences
- Author style-based recipe suggestions
- Customizable recommendation weights
- Multiple planning modes (quick setup, detailed planning)

### üì∏ Photo-to-Recipe Import
- **SmartPlate Integration**: Upload food photos to automatically extract recipes
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses GPT-4 Vision to identify ingredients, measurements, and cooking instructions
- **Seamless Library Integration**: Imported recipes are immediately available in your recipe collection
- **Smart Data Mapping**: Converts extracted data into our structured Recipe format with proper ingredient typing

#### How Photo-to-Recipe Works:
1. **Upload Photo**: Click "Upload Photo" in the Import Recipe flow
2. **SmartPlate Analysis**: Image is sent to our SmartPlate GPT endpoint for processing
3. **Recipe Extraction**: AI analyzes the photo and returns structured JSON with:
   - Recipe title and estimated servings
   - Ingredient list with precise measurements
   - Step-by-step cooking instructions
   - Difficulty level and cooking time
4. **Library Integration**: Extracted recipe is converted to our Recipe type and added to your collection
5. **Immediate Access**: Recipe appears in your library and can be used in meal planning

**API Integration**: The feature uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision model through our SmartPlate prompt engineering for optimal recipe extraction accuracy.

### üìä Nutrition Tracking
- Comprehensive macronutrient tracking
- Visual nutrition charts and progress indicators
- Personalized nutritional goals
- Daily and weekly nutrition summaries

### üõí Shopping & Pantry Management
- Automated shopping list generation
- Pantry inventory tracking with expiration dates
- Smart ingredient suggestions based on planned meals
- Category-based organization

### üë§ User Profile Management
- Dietary preferences and restrictions
- Fitness goals tracking
- Food preferences (likes/dislikes)
- Cooking experience and time availability settings

## Nutrition Calculation

- Each `RecipeIngredient` uses its `id` to look up a `FoodItem` in `veg_library_with_weights.ndjson`.
- `averageWeightPerPiece` converts "piece" units to grams for accurate nutrition calculation.
- We compute `weightInGrams` for every ingredient, then multiply by per-gram nutrients & cost from the FoodItem.
- Sum all ingredients, then divide by `recipe.servings` (default 4) for per-serving macros + cost.
- All changes are commented directly in `ingredientUtils.ts` and `nutritionService.ts`.
- We assume 1 ml = 1 g if unit === 'ml' for liquid ingredients.

### Manual Testing

To verify nutrition calculations work correctly:

1. Open browser console
2. Check any recipe's `recipe.nutrition.calories` value
3. Verify it matches: `sum(ingredientWeightInGrams √ó FoodItem.caloriesPer100g / 100) √∑ 4`
4. Similarly verify `nutrition.cost` using `FoodItem.costPer100g`

Example test recipe: "Mediterranean Quinoa Bowl" should show calculated nutrition values in the meal planning interface.

## Core Services

### Photo Import Service

The `photoImportService.ts` handles communication with our SmartPlate GPT:

- **Image Analysis**: Converts uploaded images to base64 and sends to GPT-4 Vision
- **Recipe Extraction**: Uses specialized prompts to extract structured recipe data
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly error messages for failed analyses
- **Data Transformation**: Maps SmartPlate response to our Recipe type system

Key functions:
- `analyzeRecipePhoto(file: File)`: Main analysis function
- `setApiKey(key: string)`: Stores OpenAI API key locally
- `getApiKey()`: Retrieves stored API key

### Recommendation Engine

The application features a sophisticated recommendation engine that considers:

- User dietary preferences
- Fitness goals and nutritional targets
- Food likes and dislikes
- Pantry contents
- Previously viewed recipes
- Cooking skill and available time

The recommendation system uses customizable weights for different factors:

- Nutritional value
- Ingredient similarity
- Pantry usage optimization
- Recipe variety

### LLM Integration

For cold-start scenarios or author-style specifications, the system can leverage LLM-based suggestions to:

- Generate recipes in specific culinary styles
- Provide cooking tips based on user preferences
- Suggest meal combinations that match nutritional goals
- Extract recipes from food photos using SmartPlate GPT

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Access the application:
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

4. (Optional) Set up photo import:
   - Get an OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
   - In the app, go to Recipes ‚Üí Upload Photo and enter your API key
   - The key is stored locally for future use
