# NutriPlan - Meal Planning Application

A comprehensive React-based meal planning application that helps users organize meals, track nutrition, manage shopping lists, and receive personalized recipe recommendations.

## Features

### üçΩÔ∏è Personalized Meal Planning
- Weekly meal planning with drag-and-drop interface
- AI-assisted meal recommendations based on preferences
- Author style-based recipe suggestions
- Customizable recommendation weights
- Multiple planning modes (quick setup, detailed planning)

### üì∏ Photo-to-Recipe Import
- **SmartPlate Integration**: Upload food photos to automatically extract recipes
- **Serverless AI Analysis**: Uses Supabase Edge Functions with GPT-4 Vision for secure photo analysis
- **No API Keys Required**: Backend handles all AI service authentication securely
- **Seamless Library Integration**: Imported recipes are immediately available in your recipe collection
- **Smart Data Mapping**: Converts extracted data into our structured Recipe format with proper ingredient typing

#### How Photo-to-Recipe Works:
1. **Upload Photo**: Click "Upload Photo" in the Import Recipe flow
2. **Serverless Analysis**: Image is sent to our Supabase Edge Function for processing
3. **AI Processing**: Edge Function calls GPT-4 Vision API to analyze the photo
4. **Recipe Extraction**: AI returns structured JSON with:
   - Recipe title and estimated servings
   - Ingredient list with precise measurements
   - Step-by-step cooking instructions
   - Difficulty level and cooking time
5. **Library Integration**: Extracted recipe is converted to our Recipe type and added to your collection
6. **Immediate Access**: Recipe appears in your library and can be used in meal planning

**Backend Architecture**: 
- Uses Supabase Edge Functions for secure, scalable photo processing
- OpenAI API key stored securely in Supabase secrets
- No client-side API key management required
- Built-in error handling and validation

**Edge Function Setup** (for developers):
```sql
-- Required Supabase setup
-- 1. Create Edge Function: analyze-recipe-photo
-- 2. Add OpenAI API key to Supabase secrets as OPENAI_API_KEY
-- 3. Deploy function with proper CORS headers
```

### üìä Nutrition Tracking
- Comprehensive macronutrient tracking
- Visual nutrition charts and progress indicators
- Personalized nutritional goals
- Daily and weekly nutrition summaries

### üõí Shopping & Pantry Management
- Automated shopping list generation
- Pantry inventory tracking with expiration dates
- Smart ingredient suggestions based on planned meals
- Category-based organization

### üë§ User Profile Management
- Dietary preferences and restrictions
- Fitness goals tracking
- Food preferences (likes/dislikes)
- Cooking experience and time availability settings

## Nutrition Calculation

- Each `RecipeIngredient` uses its `id` to look up a `FoodItem` in `veg_library_with_weights.ndjson`.
- `averageWeightPerPiece` converts "piece" units to grams for accurate nutrition calculation.
- We compute `weightInGrams` for every ingredient, then multiply by per-gram nutrients & cost from the FoodItem.
- Sum all ingredients, then divide by `recipe.servings` (default 4) for per-serving macros + cost.
- All changes are commented directly in `ingredientUtils.ts` and `nutritionService.ts`.
- We assume 1 ml = 1 g if unit === 'ml' for liquid ingredients.

### Manual Testing

To verify nutrition calculations work correctly:

1. Open browser console
2. Check any recipe's `recipe.nutrition.calories` value
3. Verify it matches: `sum(ingredientWeightInGrams √ó FoodItem.caloriesPer100g / 100) √∑ 4`
4. Similarly verify `nutrition.cost` using `FoodItem.costPer100g`

Example test recipe: "Mediterranean Quinoa Bowl" should show calculated nutrition values in the meal planning interface.

## Core Services

### Photo Import Service

The `photoImportService.ts` handles communication with our Supabase Edge Function:

- **Image Upload**: Sends images via FormData to our Edge Function
- **Error Handling**: Provides user-friendly error messages for failed analyses
- **Data Transformation**: Maps AI response to our Recipe type system
- **Security**: No client-side API key management required

Key functions:
- `analyzeRecipePhoto(file: File)`: Main analysis function that calls our Edge Function
- Automatic validation of AI response structure
- Built-in error handling and user feedback

### Supabase Edge Function Architecture

The serverless backend handles:

1. **Image Processing**: Receives multipart form data with images
2. **AI Integration**: Securely calls OpenAI GPT-4 Vision API
3. **Response Validation**: Ensures structured recipe data is returned
4. **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error responses
5. **Security**: API keys stored in Supabase secrets, never exposed to client

**Required Environment Variables** (in Supabase secrets):
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for GPT-4 Vision access

### Recommendation Engine

The application features a sophisticated recommendation engine that considers:

- User dietary preferences
- Fitness goals and nutritional targets
- Food likes and dislikes
- Pantry contents
- Previously viewed recipes
- Cooking skill and available time

The recommendation system uses customizable weights for different factors:

- Nutritional value
- Ingredient similarity
- Pantry usage optimization
- Recipe variety

### LLM Integration

For cold-start scenarios or author-style specifications, the system can leverage LLM-based suggestions to:

- Generate recipes in specific culinary styles
- Provide cooking tips based on user preferences
- Suggest meal combinations that match nutritional goals
- Extract recipes from food photos using SmartPlate GPT via Edge Functions
